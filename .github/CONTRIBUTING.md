# How to contribute
Support from the community is essential to keeping caniuse.email up-to-date. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

- If making a change to a supported feature in the data.json if possible please include a screenshot, description and any other relevant info. Please be sure that the change has been tested and is valid.
- If adding a new email client, please be sure that the client has significant marketshare so the data would be useful to others.
